So my topic today would be the one which we discussed  last week :Work to live or Live to work;
Some of your oppion inspire me and i will analyse my own oppion as :Even we think our work is what we think we will  enjoy very much ,we should Work to Live;
I may occupy you about 3 minuntes ,So beg your pardon firstly;  
 i will get started by putting up a premise like this"We all live to be well-being"ï¼Œwhich everybody will admit;
As some of you once said:Finding myself being well-being doing my work ,i work to live;
But i think there is something neglected .Or in other words :if we admit this oppion is right,we must admit the premise goes like this:i won't change my love for my work even after many years;
I am not talking about "We will lose our love for our work after doing it repeatly;
Of course you can have this comprehension,but waht i really wanna say is that"We do not konw what we really are";
What determine our future is not what we know at this time.That is beause we are changing everytime as long as we are living;
So i believe maybe we 'd better step back a little ,yeah setp back from constraining our future with what we think we enjoy deeply ,Putting ourself in an changable place ,We can change as we like ,lt is the best;
That all
Sorry again for occupying so much time;
